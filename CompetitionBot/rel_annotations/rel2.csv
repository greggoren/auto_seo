For an extra special experience, book onto a catamaran trip and be shown some of the best spots on the island! My partner plunged deep into the ocean to dive amongst some impressive wrecks. His favorite was the sunken submarine, not far from St Peters Bay. Along with plenty of colorful exotic fish (including lionfish), there were a few turtles down there too.",barbados,167_3,-1.6639282703399658,,,4,7XUGJ0,100

That is great if you need that level of service. Most families do not. Dropping to a lower, more appropriate speed could reduce your monthly bill by $35 or more, depending on your carrier. Consult the chart below to help determine what speed you need, then contact your provider to lower your plan. The recommended speeds assume multiple devices doing the activities listed, so you can adjust down if you only have one device gaming or streaming HD video at a time, for example. If you already have cable, you can save more than $1,000 over two years with some providers by bundling your cable and internet service. Beware of the up-sell. Carriers may try to talk you into extra speed or channels for $5 or $10 more per month. ",cheap internet,010_2,-0.8247338533401489,,,7,7XUGJ0,100
