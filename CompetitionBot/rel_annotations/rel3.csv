For this reason, people with some injuries can use an elliptical to stay fit, as the low impact affects them little. Elliptical trainers offer a non-impact cardiovascular workout that can vary from light to high intensity based on the speed of the exercise and the resistance preference set by the user.
Most elliptical trainers work the user's upper and lower body. Though elliptical trainers are considered to be minimal-impact, they are an example of a weight-bearing form of exercise. They can be self-powered by user-generated motion or need to be plugged in for adjustment of motion and/or for supplying their electronic consoles and resistance systems.
",Find information about elliptical trainer machines.,41:47.2,4,"Ellipticals offer the benefit of a low-impact workout while exercising both your upper and lower body. Elliptical trainers can be forgiving to aging joints while giving you a good aerobic workout and helping you burn calories for weight loss. Elliptical trainers also reduce the stress and strain on your legs through an elliptical motion. In addition, there is no reverse action. The shape of the elliptical movement mimics the natural path of the ankle, knee, and hip joints during walking, jogging, or running. To reduce the strain on your joints, many elliptical trainers are equipped with articulating foot pedals that conform to your stride. Not only do your feet never leave the pedal, but also the pedal adjusts to the angle of the elliptical stride.",elliptical trainer,033_1,-4.536264896,,,2,2WJNDY,60
