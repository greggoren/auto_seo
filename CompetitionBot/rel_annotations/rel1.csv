The best internet service provider is different for everyone. Monthly price is directly linked to speed which depends on a lot of factors, like your online activities and the number of people who use your internet. Additionally, internet pricing and promotions change frequently. One of the easiest ways to lower your internet bill and getting the cheapest price is to compare prices occasionally. Just because the service provider you signed up with had the best price a few years ago does not mean they still hold the title for the cheapest Internet service in your community.
