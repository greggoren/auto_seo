If you’re among the Americans who cannot afford a typical, yet expensive, high-speed internet, the programs like Internet Essentials, Internet Basics and Connect2Compete may help you get online at a cheap price you can afford. Of course, some of the programs provide service with a catch. For example, time limits on your monthly browsing,

Do the math: If your wedding comes to $100 per person for food and drink, cutting your list from 150 to 100 saves $5,000. Wedding Style: The less formal the affair, the more affordable. Instead of a sit-down dinner, go for a casual brunch or barbecue. Get rental cars in lieu of limos. Wedding Invitations: Keep the wedding invitations simple. Remember, top-quality paper, fancy typography techniques and custom-colored inks increase the price, as do decorative envelope linings and multiple enclosures.

Sometimes this is a dollar amount that you can build right into your budget, and other times it is a particular portion of the wedding that they?re going to pay (up to a certain amount) on your behalf. Do the math: If your wedding comes to $100 per person for food and drink, cutting your list from 150 to 100 saves $5,000. Wedding Style: The less formal the affair, the more affordable. Instead of a sit-down dinner, go for a casual brunch or barbecue. Get rental cars in lieu of limos. Wedding Invitations: Keep the wedding invitations simple. Remember, top-quality paper, fancy typography techniques and custom-colored inks increase the price, as do decorative envelope linings and multiple enclosures. Choose one fabulous element and keep all the rest simple. Use response postcards or make save-the-date cards yourself. To keep postage costs down, stay away from oversize or overweight styles.
