Style: No matter what your budget, a chic, high-end wedding can be yours without sacrificing a single iota of style.
Guest List: Invite 100 guests instead of 150. Do the math: If your wedding comes to $100 per person for food and drink, cutting your list from 150 to 100 saves $5,000.
Wedding Style: The less formal the affair, the more affordable. Instead of a sit-down dinner, go for a casual brunch or barbecue. Get rental cars in lieu of limos.
Wedding Invitations: Keep the wedding invitations simple. Remember, top-quality paper, fancy typography techniques and custom-colored inks increase the price, as do decorative envelope linings and multiple enclosures. Choose one unique element and keep all the rest simple. Make save-the-date cards yourself.
