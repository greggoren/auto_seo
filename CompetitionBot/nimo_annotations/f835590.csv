A toilet can be designed for people who prefer to sit (by using a toilet pedestal) or for people who prefer to squat and use a squat toilet. Flush toilets, which are common in many parts of the world (particularly in more affluent countries or regions), may be connected to a septic tank or - more commonly in urban areas - via a sewer to a sewage treatment plant.  ","Unless you buy one of the sleek, new one-piece models, you'll have to buy both a bowl and a tank. They'll come in two separate boxes. Have a Lowe's customer service associate help you ensure the two components match. Almost any tank you purchase will come with the flush-valve assembly already installed, but it never hurts to check this as well. In addition, you'll need new closet bolts, a wax gasket, and a toilet seat if these aren't included. There are complete kits that include the tank, bowl, wax ring and a hardware kit.

Never fear—there are still plenty of options for low-priced and even free Internet service available to all comers. Of course, some of those ISPs provide service with a catch. For example, you may have to accept time limits on your monthly browsing, go without high-speed access or pay a premium for it, and in the case of some offers, service is only available in specific regions or metropolitan areas. So why would anyone provide free or ultra-cheap Internet service, anyway? What's in it for them? You might be surprised to learn that a decade ago, there were dozens of ISPs providing free service.

Answer:
It may not be necessary to take a course in preparation for the GMAT.  If you are very organized and approach preparing for the GMAT as carefully as you do for your applications, you are in a position to study on your own.
The average test-taker takes three to six months to prepare for the test.  You may need more or less time depending on how much time you can devote to preparing on a daily and/or weekly basis.
If you have not studied or you having difficulty remembering how to solve the quantitative questions and are in need of instruction, it may be more helpful for you to take an introductory math course at a local college than to take a GMAT prep course.  ","Preparing for the GMAT exam takes time and effort, but with a sound study plan, you can get the score you want.
Being a little nervous about taking the GMAT exam is normal. Smart test takers approach the test with a solid plan and execute on that plan. They get the most out of practice tests and resources, understand how they learn, and stay positive throughout the process. Just remind yourself that you have what it takes! Like any important goal, preparation and hard work pay off. 
The following steps will help you plan a course toward your best GMAT.

Style: No matter what your budget, a chic, high-end wedding can be yours without sacrificing a single iota of style.
Guest List: Invite 100 guests instead of 150. Do the math: If your wedding comes to $100 per person for food and drink, cutting your list from 150 to 100 saves $5,000.
Wedding Style: The less formal the affair, the more affordable. Instead of a sit-down dinner, go for a casual brunch or barbecue. Get rental cars in lieu of limos.
Wedding Invitations: Keep the wedding invitations simple. Remember, top-quality paper, fancy typography techniques and custom-colored inks increase the price, as do decorative envelope linings and multiple enclosures. Choose one unique element and keep all the rest simple. Make save-the-date cards yourself.

Many elliptical trainers use alternating push/pull resistance bars to add an upperbody workout as you stride. The pedals can also be reversed (backward stride), which not only works the muscles in a slightly different manner but allows some variation in your workout.

of stair-stepping with cross-country skiing,
providing a low-impact aerobic workout.
Many elliptical trainers use alternating
push/pull resistance bars to add an upperbody
workout as you stride. The pedals
can also be reversed (backward stride),
which not only works the muscles in a
slightly different manner but allows some
variation in your workout.
There are two main types of elliptical
machines available: rear-drive and frontdrive.
Rear-drive units enable a true
elliptical movement of the pedals and
include an adjustable incline ramp at the
front of the machine. A front-drive elliptical
machine, on the other hand, needs to use
articulating pedals in order to match a
natural stride and lacks the adjustable
ramp of a rear-drive unit. Most users tend

A common mistake people make when decorating a new condo is rushing out to a couple stores to buy things just to fill the space.

It is important to clean dirt and manure from the underside of the hooves as well as lodged rocks, sticks or even pine cones that can cause discomfort and bruising. As you visually check your whole horse check for any swellings or cuts around the foot. If your farrier recommends it, coat your horse’s hooves with a moisturizing dressing. If your horse has weak hoof walls consider trying one of the many feed supplements that claim to benefit hoof growth. About every six weeks, a farrier should trim down growth, help correct any hoof problems and suggest proper care depending on your horse’s use and environment. "," There are many different hoof problems that can occur in horses. To reduce hoof problems, follow these recommendations: Regular trimming or shoeing, Maintain good hoof balance, Maintain the correct hoof pastern angle, break over, and medial-lateral balance ,Give heel support if needed ,Use appropriate shoeing for different weather and footing conditions ,Use appropriate treatment if disease process occurs.
Poor shoeing or trimming. Long toes can results in strain on flexor tendons, the navicular bone, and collapsed heels. If the horse is ""too upright"" it can cause trauma to the coffin bone. An imbalanced hoof can cause stress on the collateral ligaments.

The hoof is the tip of a toe of an ungulate mammal, strengthened by a thick horny (keratin) covering. The hoof consists of a hard or rubbery sole, and a hard wall formed by a thick nail rolled around it's tip.
The weight of the animal is normally borne by both the sole and the edge of the hoof wall. Hooves grow continuously, and are constantly worn down by use.
Nowadays horses have to carry heavy work load, work on abrasive footing or work long hours all on theirs feet.

Of course, some of the programs provide service with a catch. For example, time limits on your monthly browsing,

","No matter what your budget, a chic, high-end wedding can be yours without sacrificing a single iota of style.
Guest List: Invite 100 guests instead of 150 (save on everything). Do the math: If your wedding comes to $100 per person for food and drink, cutting your list from 150 to 100 saves $5,000.
Wedding Style: The less formal the affair, the more affordable. Instead of a sit-down dinner, go for a casual brunch or barbecue. Get rental cars in lieu of limos.
Wedding Invitations: Keep the wedding invitations simple. Remember, top-quality paper, fancy typography techniques and custom-colored inks increase the price, as do decorative envelope linings and multiple enclosures.

You don't have to rush to IKEA, Pottery Barn or Wal-mart stores we have it all online for cheap prices.","Can condo dwellers still have it all while living small?
Yes! insists designer Karin Bohne of Vancouver’s Moeski Design Agency.
Although space is often sacrificed for urban living, Bohne says a ton of square footage isn’t a requirement for a well designed home.
A little strategic planning can go a long way in a small space, says the designer.
A common mistake people make when decorating a new condo is rushing out to a couple stores to buy things just to fill the space.
Don’t feel like you have to go out and buy everything at once, explains Bohne.
Oftentimes the space will end up looking more like a catalogue than a home.
Instead the designer recommends taking your time, doing your research, and selecting pieces that will enhance your home and represent your personal style.",Choosing Furniture for Small Spaces ,The Dos and Don'ts of Decorating Your Small Space.,161,furniture small spaces,5,,shraga89

Programming involves analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (coding) of algorithms in a target programming language. Source code is written in one or more programming languages. The process of programming requires expertise or knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and formal logic. Related tasks include testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code, implementation of the build system, and management of derived artifacts such as machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term ""programming"", ""implementation"", or ""coding"" reserved for the actual writing of source code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices.","Technical Writing:
